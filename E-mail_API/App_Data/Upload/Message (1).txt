Header: Hi Scott,
Content: Thanks for the e-mail. It is always nice to hear from people, especially from you, Scott. I have not got any reply, a positive or negative one, from Seibido yet. Let's wait and hope that it will make a BOOK. Have you finished your paperwork for Karen and writing academic articles? If you have some free time in the near future, I want to meet you! Also I want to explain to you our next project. Why not drink out in Hiroshima if we are accepted? We need to celebrate ourselves, don't we? Let's have a small end-of-the-year party
Footer: See you soon, Katarina
